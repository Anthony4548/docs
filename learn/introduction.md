## Introduction of MAP Protocol

MAP Protocol is a blockchain interoperable protocol designated for cross-chain Dapps, application-ready, all-chain coverage, cost-efficient, and security-finality.

MAP Protocol provides instant confirmation and verification finality by Light-client, supports smart contract development on Map Relay Chain, offers cross-chain services components for Dapp's convenient deployment, and enables universal connections with all chains by proactively embedding other chains' feature as pre-compiled contracts in EVM layer of Map Relay Chain. MAP Protocol maintains a cost-efficient network by simply charging Map Relay Chain's gas fee for cross-chain transactions.

While cross-chain bridges can be easily built with MAP protocol, the protocol itself targets a more fundamental problem and pursues grander vision: boosting the whole cross-chain ecosystem by building a solid cross-chain Dapp infrastructure. Any Dapp built with the infrastructure automatically inherits the cross-chain nature of MAP protocol without requiring the developers to tackle the error-prone cross-chain communications. With the technical threshold of building cross-chain Dapp reduced, the ecosystem shall thrive.

Thus, together with worldwide developers, MAP Protocol is the dawn of a new cross-chain age.
