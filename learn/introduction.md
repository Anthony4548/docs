## Introduction of MAP Protocol

MAP Protocol is a blockchain interoperable protocol designated for cross-chain Dapps, **application-ready, all-chain coverage, cost-efficient, and security-finality**.

MAP Protocol provides instant confirmation and verification finality by Light-client, supports smart contract development on Map Relay Chain, offers cross-chain services components for Dapp's convenient deployment, and enables universal connections with all chains by proactively embedding other chains' feature as pre-compiled contracts in EVM layer of Map Relay Chain. MAP Protocol maintains a cost-efficient network by simply charging Map Relay Chain's gas fee for cross-chain transactions.

While cross-chain bridges can be easily built with MAP protocol, the protocol itself targets a more fundamental problem and pursues grander vision: boosting the whole cross-chain ecosystem by building a solid cross-chain Dapp infrastructure. Any Dapp built with the infrastructure automatically inherits the cross-chain nature of MAP protocol without requiring the developers to tackle the error-prone cross-chain communications. With the technical threshold of building cross-chain Dapp reduced, the ecosystem shall thrive.

Thus, together with worldwide developers, MAP Protocol is the dawn of a new cross-chain age. Developers can easily build their omnichain applications deployed on any chain in **just two steps**:

1. **Build inter-chain messenger using our SDK.**
2. **Interact with on-chain vault and data through our API.**


## Features of MAP Protocol 

### Security-Finality
Guarantee blockchain-level security through an independent self-verification network formed by light clients on every public blockchain.

### All-Chain Coverage
Embed heterogeneous chains' signing and hashing algorithm into the EVM layer of the MAP Relay Chain to ensure seamless communication between all chains.

### Instant Confirmation
Inter-chain communication programs and on-chain smart contracts work together efficiently to ensure that speed is only related to each chain's block time.

### Minimum Cost
MAP Protocol only charge the gas fee of MAP Relay Chain and other related chains with no additional cost.

### Developer-Ready
Through MAP Cross-Chain Service (MCS) deployed on and between public chains, dAPPs can share the liquidity of MCS's Vaults on different chains, and customize the entry threshold and incentive model of inter-chain program: messenger. Alternatively, we can use the MCS open source code to build dAPP-related Omnichain components.
