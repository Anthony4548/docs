## Background

### Three stages of crypto industry development

Stage 1: Bitcoin
The birth of the Bitcoin peer-to-peer e-cash payment system created the crypto industry and stimulated the development of centralized exchanges (CEXs) since 2009.

Stage 2: Ethereum
The emergence of the programmable smart contract of Ethereum boosted the development of public chains and decentralized applications (Dapps) since 2015.

Stage 3: Multi-chain - Call for cross-chain
Although cross-chain infrastructure competition is neck and neck, cross-chain infrastructure makes cross-chain dapps possible and significantly boosts development.

### Cross-chain field

Let’s start by explaining what blockchain and cross-chain are. Blockchain is a network in which one block of transactions sequentially follows another and the network is supported by miners/nodes. The first blockchain is the Bitcoin blockchain, since its launch many other blockchains have been created. An important milestone in the development of blockchain technology was the launch of the Ethereum network with the support for smart contracts. Ethereum dominated the market, Dapps started to deploy on Ethereum. After Ethereum, more public chains were launched to challenge Ethereum, and Dapps started to explore possibilities on different chains. Nowadays, Dapps are deployed on multiple chains and as a result, users also own digital assets on multiple chains, and they are desperately in need of a secure and efficient cross-chain solution. Not just a bridge, but a cross-chain interoperability protocol as a solution.

### Existing problems - Centralization

Non-interoperable

### Existing cross-chain solutions in the crypto industry

The solution to the problem of blockchains interoperability can be the very factor to ensure world recognition of blockchain technology and all its derivatives, primarily, cryptocurrencies. Having a cross-chain protocol in place gives projects freedom of choice and opens up fair competition: if one network is cheaper or faster than the other one, assets can move freely. This will mean, neither more nor less, a new economic era, which will be determined by genuine economic freedom and the broadest financial and working opportunities.

- Solutions without a Relay Chain
  * Cross-chain bridge dapps with MPC super administrator
  * Oracle verification mechanism with ambiguity and collusion risk
  * The transitional solution in MPC with PoS. (Slightly better than pure MPC)
  * Optimistic roll-up with long verification waiting time
  * Light-client verification mechanism with ultra-high gas fees during cross-chain among heterogeneous chains

- Polkadot & Cosmos Solution

  * It is difficult for the EVM and other heterogeneous chains to connect the cross-chain network through SDK.
  * The relay chain is dedicated to blockchain mainnet developers instead of cross-chain dapp developers.  
  * Although Thorchain and Terra are Cosmos’s ecosystem chains, the cross-chain mechanism of Thorchain is still MPC, and dapps developed on Terra are mostly mono-chain dapps.
  * Polkadot has not yet developed any cross-chain applications. 

## Introduction of MAP Protocol

MAP Protocol is a blockchain interoperable protocol designated for cross-chain Dapps, application-ready, all-chain coverage, cost-efficient, and security-finality.

MAP Protocol provides verification finality by Light-client, supports smart contract development on Map Relay Chain, offers cross-chain services components for Dapp's convenient deployment, and enables universal connections with all chains by proactively embedding other chains' feature as pre-compiled contracts in EVM layer of Map Relay Chain. MAP Protocol maintains a cost-efficient network by simply charging Map Relay Chain's gas fee for cross-chain transactions.

While cross-chain bridges can be easily built with MAP protocol, the protocol itself targets a more fundamental problem and pursues grander vision: boosting the whole cross-chain ecosystem by building a solid cross-chain Dapp infrastructure. Any Dapp built with the infrastructure automatically inherits the cross-chain nature of MAP protocol without requiring the developers to tackle the error-prone cross-chain communications. With the technical threshold of building cross-chain Dapp reduced, the ecosystem shall thrive.

Thus, together with worldwide developers, MAP Protocol is the dawn of a new cross-chain age.


## History of MAP Protocol
### Genesis: In the summer of 2019

MAP team was founded in the summer of 2019. Although there was a downfall in the crypto market, CEXs was still making huge profits. With the mission of constructing a cross-chain peer-to-peer e-cash payment system infrastructure, MAP Protocol started to be built by a team of senior blockchain research experts, experienced smart contract developers, and bottom-layer blockchain engineering experts. The MAP team deeply agrees with the classic Satoshi Nakamoto’s doctrine of blockchain and believes that cross-chain technology should not deviate from it and should contribute to a trustful peer-to-peer blockchain universe.

### Phase 1.0: MAP Protocol v1.0 in 2020 Q4

MAP Protocol v1.0  is a cross-chain solution with light-client verification and without a relay chain. Version 1.0 was based on an in-depth study of Cosmos and Polkadot - from their design architecture to underlying codes. Research continues on technologies including MPC (Multi-Party Computation), Rollups, Light-Client, Oracle, and cross-chain messengers. Version 1.0 consisted of a Relayer for transferring cross-chain messages, and Light-client providing cross-chain verification finality without a relay chain.
However, when Light-client conducted cross-chain verification between heterogeneous chains, the level of complexity and difficulties increased dramatically, and a tremendous amount of gas fees were consumed, which made Version 1.0 only applicable theoretically.

### Phase 2.0: MAP Protocol v2.0 in 2021

MAP Protocol v2.0, The final generation cross-chain infrastructure for all crypto communities, was developed. With more top experts joining in 2021, the MAP team began to develop the current version - MAP Protocol v2.0:  MAP Relay Chain proactively embeds precompiled smart contracts on EVM layer for heterogeneous chains' features; Messengers transfer cross-chain messages; Light-clients conduct cross-chain self-verification; Vaults & Data manage cross-chain assets and data;  cross-chain communication components are deployed via on-chain and inter-chain ways to achieve cross-chain and cross-chain verification; and also make MAP Relay Chain ready for cross-chain Dapp deployment. MAP Protocol v2.0 is coming into form.

- Has the same technical components as Cosmos and Polkadot: cross-chain communication components, relay chain, and Light-client.
- Unlike Cosmos and Polkadot, MAP Protocol connects to all types of blockchains by proactively deploying on-chain and inter-chain cross-chain communication components.
- By adding EVM and heterogeneous chains’ signatures, hashes, mining, and Merkle proof calculation to the EVM level of MAP Relay Chain, the gas cost consumed by Light-client’s heterogeneous cross-chain verification is optimized. (One transaction, one verification)
- By providing Turing completeness in the MAP Relay Chain, developers can directly deploy cross-chain applications on MAP Protocol.
- Support cross-chain data, fungible tokens, and NFTs.
- Support cross-chain on all chains no matter if they are EVM chains or heterogeneous chains.
- Provide MAP Cross-Chain services, like Google Mobile Services, to facilitate the convenient deployment for cross-chain dapp developers.

It is complex and challenging to develop a cross-chain infrastructure that provides security finality and is dapp developer-friendly. The three-year development journey was filled with trial & error and frustrations, but MAP Team adhered to the mission to develop a cross-chain peer-to-peer e-cash payment system infrastructure. MAP team now proudly announces that MAP Protocol is the ultimate cross-chain infrastructure that outranks all the existing cross-chain solutions in blockchain space - designed for Dapp developers, all chain-compatible, security finality, and cost-efficient - The Ultimate Generation of Cross-chain infrastructure. Looking into the future, the MAP team has a detailed roadmap. Most importantly, the MAP team is focusing on completing the connections with active EVM-compatible and heterogeneous chains in the market and will support the new up-rising blockchains in the future. The MAP Team feels excited to be part of the third development stage of the crypto industry: The Cross-chain Era. We will stand along with crypto communities and cross-chain dapp developers to propel the unlimited growth of the Cross-chain Era.
