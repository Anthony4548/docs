## MAPO Relay Chain

MAP protocol shares lots of similar features of Polkadot and Cosmos, i.e., rely on cryptographic proof rather than trusted entities when verifying cross-chain message, facilitate cross-chain transfer as well cross-chain swap, the dedicated MAPO Relay Chain also adopts Proof-of-Stake and Byzantine Consensus just as Polkadot and Cosmos. Yet, the biggest difference is that Polkadot and Cosmos have been focusing on connecting isomorphic chains within its own ecosystem, e.g. blockchains built with Substrate or Tendermint Core and Cosmos-SDK. This kind of explains the current isolation state of both realms from the flourishing EVM world. With MAP protocol, we started our journey with the mission to connect heterogeneous blockchains, with dedicated MAPO Relay Chain, we can easily add in necessary features to connect all existing blockchains as well as those yet to come. By supporting IBC protocol on MAP chain, MAP chain can easily talk to the Cosmos world, by integrating ICMP protocol, MAP chain can connect Polkadot world, etc.

MAPO Relay Chain is fully EVM compatible build upon Proof-of-Stake mechanism and Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus protocol. The main purpose of MAPO Relay Chain is to maintain light clients of all interested blockchains to facilitate the trustless verification of cross-chain message. Only in this way, can MAP protocol eliminate the unreliable human factor from the cross-chain communication, especially the assets management process. That is, the correctness of the light client is the trust anchor of the whole MAP protocol. Thus, the main task of MAPO Relay Chain is to maintain this anchor trust in pure mathematical way so that users of MAP protocol need to trust only the safety of the cryptographic primitives that already form the foundation of the whole blockchain universe.
