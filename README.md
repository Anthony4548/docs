# Introduction

MAP Protocol is a decentralized cross-chain interoperability protocol backed by a dedicated blockchain that safeguards cross-chain assets and empowers Dapps to achieve its full potential. MAP Protocol is more than just a bridge, but a truly decentralized cross-chain interoperability protocol. MAP Protocol empowers developers to build all kinds of cross-chain Defi applications on it which helps to solve the interoperability issue and achieve dynamic liquidity migration across the blockchain universe.

## Our Vision
With MAP protocol, our vision is to create a quick, seamless experience that links between smart contract chains, eventually creating a network on multiple chains through which users can use every interoperable cross-chain service from one chain to another without having to use CEXes.

## Our Strength

We are building a whole solution in a truely trustless and decentralized way.

1. MAP Protocol solution is more decentralized. It is secured by 100+ staked validators and maintained by 10000+ relayers. This is to preserve the features towards decentralization.

2. On-chain Randomness. Relayers can participate in the on-chain random number generation process by submitting a random number of their own. All random numbers submitted will be merged to forge true on-chain randomness to support various DeFi applications.

## Abstract

### What is cross-chain solution
Let’s start by explaining what blockchain and cross-chain are. Blockchain is a network in which one block of transactions sequentially follows another and the network is supported by miners/nodes. The first blockchain is the Bitcoin blockchain, since its launch many other blockchains have been created. An important milestone in the development of blockchain technology was the launch of the Ethereum network with the support for smart contracts. Ethereum dominated the market, Dapps started to deploy on Ethereum. After Ethereum, more public chains have been launched to challenge Ethereum, and Dapps started to explore possibilities on different chains. Nowadays, Dapps are deployed on multiple chains and as a result, users also own digital assets on multiple chains, and they are desperately in need of a secure and efficient cross-chain solution. Not just a bridge, but a cross-chain interoperability protocol as a solution.

###  Why cross-chain solution
The solution to the problem of blockchains interoperability can be the very factor to ensure world recognition of blockchain technology and all its derivatives, primarily, cryptocurrencies. Having a cross-chain protocol in place gives projects freedom of choice and opens up the fair competition: if one network is cheaper or faster than the other one, assets can move freely. This will mean, neither more nor less, a new economic era, which will be determined by genuine economic freedom and the broadest financial and working opportunities.

### How does MAP Protocol become the leader of the cross-chain field?
The core ethos of blockchain is that code is the law. We need to trust code rather than human-being and get rid of trusted agencies. However, many cross-chain projects still manage their project with their own custody and send orders in a centralized manner for cross-chain transactions.
Since its launch in 2019, MAP protocol has been committed to the principle of decentralized asset contract custody and calls and continued to push development and operation.
MAP Protocol allows crypto users to transact on different blockchain mainnets in a trustless, efficient, and barrier-free manner in the context of web3, so as to boost users’ benefits of financial assets. At present, the coexistence of many public chains with high market value has become an indisputable reality, and many industry celebrities have claimed that cross-chain will become the next wave of hot issues. What users and the industry is are pursuing is a completely decentralized cross-chain that can protect them from Rug Pull. And the community should participate in the whole process and share profits and benefits. MAP is the first well equipped with the required technical mechanism and economic model. The ultimate goal of MAP Protocol is to create a blockchain network of highways, capable of realizing communications that are permissionless.

## Background
### Relayer
Relays enable blockchain interoperability by allowing chains to verify events and block headers on another chain. Essentially, this simply means a contract on one chain (Chain A) is able to notice and verify event changes on Chain B. The noticing part is handled by nodes known as ‘Relayers’, where they are the actual workhorses responsible for relaying cross-chain messages to keep MAP chain and all relevant contracts updated. The verify part is feasible thanks to cryptographic proof as well as the concept of the light client. Due to the vital position of the relayers, all relayers in MAP protocol are incentivized by measuring the work completed.
### Validator
Validators secure the blockchain network by validating and relaying transactions, proposing, verifying and finalizing blocks. Validators can stake their own tokens or be delegated tokens from other atom holders. There will be 100+ validators who will be individually required to operate highly reliable automated signing infrastructure. Validators on MAP blockchain will be able to charge delegators a commission in MAP for their work in securing the network.
### Vault
The protocol is stabilized, and users are protected because whenever withdrawals are made from Vault. If the users keep their investments in the system for long periods, the more fees they’ll earn, based on the length of time that their funds are kept in the system; it means that every fee paid by those withdrawing gets distributed to every other investing user.
### Light Client
Unlike full node, a light client node does not need to query and store tons of information about the blockchain. Light clients normally store only a small set of information that is just enough to verify the status change of the target chain so that they can be updated in a self-verifiable way. Besides, to verify cross-chain messages submitted by relayers, light clients will also store a handful of blockchain headers of the target chain. With the existence of a light client, the cross-chain message verification can be done in a purely mathematical way instead of having a federation to verify events on another chain. That is with the trusted Merkel root that usually exists in the blockchain header stored in the light client, the Merkle proof backing up the cross-chain message can be tested.
