## Getting Super Powers

MAP protocol aims to be the secure end-to-end solution for any blockchain resident to move and exchange assets. To fulfill this role, MAP team is building on three layers simultaneously: a dedicated blockchain served as the infrastructure freeway connecting all kinds of blockchains to break the barriers, the MAP Assets layer where all kinds of assets are mapped to MAP chain in a non-custodial style via trustless smart contract, and the DeFi Application layer where all kinds of applications including but not limited to DEXes, games and NFTs can be built with the cross-chain capabilities enabled by the MAP chain and MAP assets.
