# DAO Governance
Governance is an important part of being involved in the MAP community. Use the following information to learn how to vote on and submit governance proposals in MAP Forum.

### Vote on a Proposal
In terms of voting, there are two types of approaches in the market: voting with lock-up and voting provided with address snapshot without lock-up. Considering the market value, voting with lock-up is beneficial to community users in the long term, however, it makes users bear the risks of price fluctuations on MAP tokens.
The core development team of MAP proposed to cooperate with Idavoll and create lock-up voting with their advanced technological modules. The mechanism provided by Idavoll will not affect the liquidity of community users and it can add modules for MAP token derivatives.

### Voting Without Affecting Liquidity
Follow these steps to vote without affecting the liquidity of MAP.
1. Users deposit MAP tokens into the Idavoll staking module which lasts for 90 days for each term. Users can stake again for the next term.
2. Users will get 21% APY of the lock-up tokens.
3. Meanwhile, users will get an XMAP as a voucher.
4. Each XMAP will automatically generate one GMAP (governance MAP) and one YMAP (yield MAP). GMAP is a voting token while YMAP is a yield token.
5. Users can participate in any governance events by owing GMAP token.
6. For users who do not want to go through the above procedure but want to participate in governance, they can buy GMAP directly from Hiveswap.
7. HiveSwap will list XMAP/MAP pair to ensure the usersâ€™ MAP lock-up that they can freely transact the MAP tokens (theoretically, XMAP contains 20% of APY, and the price will be 20% higher than the MAP price)
8. HiveSwap will list XMAP/GMAP pair. The initial price is set as 1GMAP = 0.2 XMAP. It will fluctuate with the market.
9. HiveSwap will list XMAP/YMAP pair. The initial price is set as 1YMAP = 0.8 XMAP. It will fluctuate with the market.
10. If users want to withdraw their MAP tokens from the staking pool, they can combine GMAPs and YMAPs in 1:1, to get the corresponding number of XMAPs, and swap XMAPs to MAP token.
11. Users need to swap MAP tokens into ETHs or USDCs on HiveSwap.
