#### How does MAP protocol achieve true decentralization?

The technology solution adopted by MAP Protocol is by using PoS mechanism. Each cross-chain pool fund is managed by PoS mechanism of the main chain. With relayer to deliver the cross-chain transaction, the security of the contract will therefore rely on the security of the main chain.

MAP Protocol adopted PoS mechanism similar to many of the PoS mechanism projects such as Ethereum 2.0, Cosmo, Terra and etc, with actual operation experience have also prove the safety of PoS.
#### What is the technical background of MAP protocol?

Hackers have continued to exploit a vulnerability in the cross-chain bridge MultiChain and about $3 million was stolen. Some people might say these are growing pains as the cross-chain field grows rapidly. But there is a singular reason why these existing bridges are not secure: They are too centralized.

For example, THORChain’s and MultiChain’s architecture are in the form of cold wallet multi-party computation (MPC) custody. MPC, although multi-signature, is still controlled by the person designated by the project. Current bridges are too centralized and will not stand the test of time.

In contrast, MAP Protocol uses an underlying blockchain (vs. person) - MAP Mainnet - to achieve the true decentralization of cross-chain mechanism. With this in mind, Map Protocol is a trustless cross-chain protocol that can safely connect values across blockchain-verse.

#### How could we participate in the MAP Protocol?

There are various ways you can join and earn with MAP Protocol:

* With our cross-chain bridge, users can:

1.Search for high return projects on different chains and safely transfer your cryptocurrencies to participate.

2.For users who own assets on multiple chains, the MAP Protocol provides a safe solution for users to transfer and manage your digital assets portfolio easily.

* Within our ecosystem, users can:

1.Vault provider - The TVL of the vault pool deployed on each public chain is very crucial for cross-chain infrastructure. If a user wants to cross-chain USDC from ETH to BSC, someone must provide a BSC version of USDC on BSC. Otherwise, the user cannot get the USDC of the BSC version. In this context, cross-chain fees and MAP incentives will be shared.

2.Validator - When MAP mainnet goes live, users can participate as validators in node staking and get MAP incentives.

3.Relayers - Relayers are responsible for helping users to deliver cross-chain messages, such as cross-chain transfer to get benefits. The Relayers also provide gas fees for cross-chain demanders. This role will share cross-chain fees with Vault providers.

4.DeFi Yield Farming (HiveSwap & UniSwap) – Users can be the liquidity provider to MAP, participate in LP farming with the pair of MAP-USDC and MAP-ETH, and other cryptocurrencies in the future.

#### What is a relayer and why do users want to participate in relayer? and what can users get benefits from it?
Relayer is Light clients of connected blockchains on MAP chain, and light clients of MAP chain on connected blockchains need to keep up with the growth of the corresponding blockchains. This is where the relayer cuts in.
Besides submitting block headers to various chains, relayers are also responsible for helping users to deliver cross-chain messages, such as cross-chain transfer. As submitting transactions to blockchains would consume gas, all relayers are rewarded according to the useful work they have accomplished, e.g., the number of effective block headers submitted, the volume of cross-chain transfer..
Users who become relayers will get high benefits from;

1.Obtain a portion of incentives from 3 billion mainnet mining rewards.

2.Sending cross-chain and light node submission information on each chain back to the MAP Chain.

3.Rewards will be distributed in each epoch based on the relay’s performance.

4.Rewards on cross-chain fees. 30% of the fee for cross-chain transactions will be rewarded to relayer users.

### What is the reason for releasing the new Token Economics?
No DAO, no ethos of Web 3. This is why MAP Protocol is fully embraced web3 and incorporates DAO governance that is run by the community. The new economic model has made a drastic cut in the percentage allocated to the Team and Foundation, and nearly 50% of tokens will be attributed to Mining and DAO.
