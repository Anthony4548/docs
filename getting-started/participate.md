# How to participate
There are various ways that users can participate in MAP Protocol.

### Vault provider
The TVL of the vault pool deployed on each public chain is very crucial for cross-chain infrastructure. If a user wants to cross-chain USDC from ETH to BSC, someone must provide a BSC version of USDC on BSC. Otherwise, the user cannot get the USDC of the BSC version. In this context, cross-chain fees and MAP incentives will be shared.

### Validator
Validators are the miners of the MAP blockchain. Staked validators are rewarded with MAP tokens according to the amount of token staked as well as the stability of their node, e.g., the efforts they devoted to maintain MAP chain. Holders of MAP tokens can either operate their own validator node or delegate their token to a well-established validator node to earn rewards.

### Relayers
Relayers are responsible for helping users to deliver cross-chain messages, such as cross-chain transfer to get benefits. The Relayers also provide gas fees for cross-chain demanders. This role will share cross-chain fees with Vault providers.

### DeFi Yield Farming
Users can be the liquidity provider to MAP, participate in LP farming with the pair of MAP-USDC and MAP-ETH, and other cryptocurrencies in the future.
