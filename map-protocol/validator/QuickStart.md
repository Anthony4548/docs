### Step 1: createAccount

Manage your account, keys, and metadata.

Keep your locked Gold more secure by authorizing alternative keys to be used for signing attestations, voting, or validating. By doing so, you can continue to participate in the protocol while keeping the key with access to your locked Gold in cold storage.

### Step 2: lockedgold

Locks ATLAS to be used in governance and validator elections.


### Step 3: affiliate group

Affiliate a Validator with a Validator Group. This allows the Validator Group to add that Validator as a member. If the Validator is already a member of a Validator Group, affiliating with a different Group will remove the Validator from the first group's members.
