## What is messenger
Messenger is an independent inter-chain program. It works for MAPO Service. 

Messenger listens to relevant events as preset in the program and builds a proof on the ledger of the source chain; then transmit the message of the event and proof to Vault or Data on the destination chain.

The flexibility of applications opens up many possibilities for Messenger, where applications can charge cross-chain users flexible transaction fees and reward Messenger accordingly.

## Messenger SDK
As a main component of MAPO Services, Messenger SDK will be open to Dapp developers.
