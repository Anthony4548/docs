# Makalu PoC-2

Makalu PoC-2 upgraded the consensus mechanism on the basis of the original PoC-1, upgraded the consensus mechanism from 
the original POW to POS, and adopted high TPS performance standards. In order to achieve the purpose of cross-chain transaction data (assets).

Makalu PoC-2 uses the IBFT algorithm to achieve message consensus between nodes, and implements Validator registration 
and election functions in the form of on-chain contracts, and supports Perform'on-chain upgrades' in a flexible way, 
while greatly increasing transaction processing speed.

Makalu PoC-2 will continue to support light client verification to verify on-chain transactions on the peer chain, 
compatible with and support EIP-1559, and PoC2 will continue to update multiple versions in a small version iteration.
