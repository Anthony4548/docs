1. MAP Protocol is designated for cross-chain Dapp developers. Not for blockchain mainnet developers. MAP Protocol is not a cross-chain bridge but a cross-chain Dapp infrastructure with cross-chain bridges as applications built on it.

2. MAP Protocol is structured in three layers: MAP Protocol Layer, MAP Cross-chain Services Layer (MCS), and MAP Application Ecosystem Layer.

3. MAP Protocol achieves cross-chain interoperability with all EVM and non-EVM chains by deploying cross-chain execution and verification via on-chain smart contracts, and cross-chain messenger inter-chain program.

4. MAP Protocol's cross-chain verification network has security finality by adopting the Light-client independent self-verification mechanism.

5. MAP Relay Chain accomplished heterogeneous expansion on the EVM level, which simplified the complexity of engineering and minimized the gas fee for cross-chain verification between heterogeneous chains.

6. By connecting with MAP Relay Chain, EVM and non-EVM chains form a cross-chain execution and verification network.

7. MAP Protocol provides SDK for the inter-chain communication component - Messenger to Dapp developers. Each Dapp can have its own Messenger and tailor-make their reward scheme, which facilitates cross-chain transactions to be completed.

8. MAP Protocol provides developers with MAP Cross-chain Services similar to Google GMS. It is convenient for developers to develop and share cross-chain asset liquidity and data.

9. MAP Protocol supports both assets and data cross-chain.

10. MAP Relay Chain supports the development of all cross-chain native Dapps, including on-chain oracle, cross-chain swap, cross-chain bridge for tokens and NFTs, decentralized derivatives, cross-chain DAO, and cross-chain GameFi, etc.


Developers can deploy cross-chain Dapps on MAP Relay Chain to achieve interoperability.
