While cross-chain bridges can be easily built with MAP Protocol, MAP Protocol itself tackles a more fundamental problem and pursues a larger vision: boosting the whole cross-chain ecosystem by **building a solid cross-chain Dapp infrastructure**. Any Dapp built with the infrastructure **automatically inherits the cross-chain nature of MAP Protocol** without requiring the developers to tackle the error-prone cross-chain communications. With the technical threshold of building cross-chain Dapp reduced, the ecosystem shall thrive.

* MAP Protocol is structured in **three layers**: MAP Protocol Layer, MAP Cross-chain Services Layer (MCS), and MAP Application Ecosystem Layer.

* MAP Protocol achieves cross-chain interoperability with **all EVM and non-EVM** chains by deploying cross-chain execution and verification via on-chain smart contracts, and cross-chain messenger inter-chain program.

* MAP Protocol's cross-chain verification network has **security finality** by adopting the Light-client independent self-verification mechanism.

* MAP Relay Chain is fully EVM compatible built upon **Proof-of-Stake** mechanism and **Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus**. 

* MAP Relay Chain accomplished heterogeneous expansion on the EVM level, which **simplified the complexity of engineering** and **minimized the gas fee** for cross-chain verification between heterogeneous chains. 

* By connecting with MAP Relay Chain, EVM and non-EVM chains form a cross-chain execution and verification network. 

* MAP Protocol provides **SDK for the inter-chain communication component - Messenger** to Dapp developers. Each Dapp can have its own Messenger and tailor-make their reward scheme, which facilitates cross-chain transactions to be completed.

* MAP Protocol provides developers with MAP Cross-chain Services similar to Google GMS. It is convenient for developers to develop and **share cross-chain asset liquidity and data**.

* MAP Protocol supports **both assets and data cross-chain**.

* MAP Relay Chain supports the development of all cross-chain native Dapps, including on-chain oracle, cross-chain swap, cross-chain bridge for tokens and NFTs, decentralized derivatives, cross-chain DAO, and cross-chain GameFi, etc.
